# homework-portfolio
This is about a portfolio assessment where I was required to build my own Portfolio website application with HTML and CSS  from scratch.I implemeted advanced css skills learned such as flexbox,media queries, CSS variables, pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements . The website  has different sections, like a header with links that should take the viewer to the different sections of the website. The website should also have a section about me, and a secion for my work, with some of the applications that I have made. When clicking on each app image the viewer should be taken to the deployed website . At the end of the website there shoud be a footer with contact links to reach me.
